The first is a card flip game. It is fully frontend based where I utilize Vue framework, together with CSS and Javascript. It can be played by two players, counts each other's scores and declares the winner in the end. It can be restarted without reloading. Here's a sneak peek to the game:

The second one is an address book application where I use Flask, Sqlite, JS, to create a full stack program where one can add, remove, and search contacts. It can be run by first running the server file 'app.py'. If it doesn't work or you are unable to login at the login window, then run the 'setup_db.py' file first and then run 'app.py' again. The login window will appear as shown below. Log in with the username and password given to check the stored contacts for that user or register as a new user and create new users.

After main page consists of several features where you can add contacts using the plus icon on the top right. The adding fields will perform input checks to validate email and telephone entries. You can change the display (font, weight) of a given value using the settings icon. You can delete the entries. It also has search option. The sort feature is only displayed here but the functionality is not added yet. Here's how the main page looks:
